MECHANICS WORK LOG
==================



Thursday 10th September

https://digilabor.ut.ee/index.php/LiPo_Manual
4x batteries
4S (4 cells -> 5 cables: 4 for each cell and 1 common (black)), 1C, 3000mAh
when charging, choose LiPo Balance (or Charge), and put 3.0A (3000mAh and 1C), and around 16V (4S)
if you put more batteries charging (in parallel), the amperage has to increase (2 batteries in parallel, then 6.0A max, might be 5.0A)
always somebody checking the charging!!! (instructors ask always about this, safety first!)
around 80% charging is healthy (not too high, not too low)
don't leave the indicator switched overnight, it might kill the battery
(for more details check pictures 20200910_4xbatteries.jpeg and 20200910_battery_charging.jpeg for PowerSource tools and wiring configuration)

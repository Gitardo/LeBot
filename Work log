Work log.

September 6th.
All team members participated on the trivia activity around the city. Final score achieved was 11 points.
The team received a previous robot from the competition held in 2018. It only was of the body of the robot.
We began working on that robot with the initial task of checking mainboard communication. We stumbled across problems as we couldn’t receive any response. We received a new board and finally achived the task.ß
